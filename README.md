# Better HIS
To show students their marks my university uses a web application.
Unfortunately it has no function to show you some information about the average marks and stuff like that.
So I added it myself.

The script works with:
- Tampermonkey Script ([Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo ) also available for Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera Next and more)
- Greasemonkey Script ([Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/))

Enjoy and feel free to give me some feedback

## Current Features
- add average marks and result mark calculation to the site
- select your estimated thesis mark by range slider
- highlight exams of the current term

## Install
If you have Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey installed the easiest way to install the script: [install now](https://github.com/jhertfe/better_his/raw/master/better_his.user.js)

# Better HIS
To show students their marks my university uses a web application.
Unfortunately it has no function to show you some information about the average marks and stuff like that.
So I added it myself.

The script works with:
- Tampermonkey Script ([https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo Chrome extension])
- Greasemonkey Script ([https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/ Firefox extension])

Enjoy and feel free to give me some feedback

## Install
The easiest way to install the script:
- click on the better_his.user.js file in the listing above
- press the "raw" button in the top right corner
- there should be an installation hint of the extention you use then
### Make sure you edit the match url!

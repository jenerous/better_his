# Better HIS
To show students their marks my university uses a web application.
Unfortunately it has no function to show you some information about the average marks and stuff like that.
So I added it myself.

The script works with:
- Tampermonkey Script ([https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo Chrome extension])
- Greasemonkey Script ([https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/ Firefox extension])

Enjoy and feel free to give me some feedback

## Install
The easiest way to install the script: [https://github.com/jhertfe/better_his/raw/master/better_his.user.js install]
### Make sure you edit the match url!
